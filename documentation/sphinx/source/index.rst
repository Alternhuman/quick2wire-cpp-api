   contain the root `toctree` directive.

quick2wire-cpp-api
==================

The quick2wire-cpp-api is a port of the `quick2wire-python-api <https://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-python-api>`_ written entirely in C/C++. It grants access to the GPIO ports to unprivileged users using the quick2wire `gpio-admin <https://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-gpio-admin>`_ tool (modified if used in **Arch Linux**).

The library is a literal port of its parent project, so users of the Python implementation should feel comfortable with this variant as well.

This is a work in progress. So far, only the GPIO is implemented (and only the OUT mode), but a port of the whole API is on the way.
